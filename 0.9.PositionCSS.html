An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position <br><br>3. An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled <br><br>4. An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed) <br><br></p>
