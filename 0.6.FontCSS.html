    <h1>LOCKHEED MARTIN F22-RAPTOR</h1>
    <p id="para_0_6">
        The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is an American single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter
        aircraft developed exclusively for the United States Air Force (USAF). The result of the USAF's Advanced
        Tactical Fighter (ATF) program, the aircraft was designed primarily as an air superiority fighter, but also has
        ground attack, electronic warfare, and signal intelligence capabilities.[2] The prime contractor, Lockheed
        Martin, built most of the F-22's airframe and weapons systems and conducted final assembly, while Boeing
        provided the wings, aft fuselage, avionics integration, and training systems.<br><br>

        The aircraft was variously designated F-22 and F/A-22 before it formally entered service in December 2005 as the
        F-22A. Despite its protracted development and various operational issues, USAF considers the F-22 a critical
        component of its tactical air power. The fighterâ€™s combination of stealth, aerodynamic performance, and avionics
        systems enable unprecedented air combat capabilities.<br><br>

        The USAF had originally planned to buy a total of 750 ATFs. In 2009, the program was cut to 187 operational
        aircraft due to high costs, a lack of clear air-to-air missions due to delays in Russian and Chinese fighter
        programs, a ban on exports, and development of the more versatile F-35.[N 1] The last F-22 was delivered in
        2012. The Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter system is expected to be a successor to the F-22.
